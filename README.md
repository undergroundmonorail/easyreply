# easyreply
a userscript for stack exchange chat

you know how you can ping me with `@undergroundmonorail`? this userscript makes it so that if you type `@undergroundmonorail@` at the beginning of your message, it'll be a reply to my most recent message. simple!

you can also send a message beginning with `@undergroundmonorail*`. no message will actually be sent, and my most recent message will be starred or unstarred.

# credit where it's due
